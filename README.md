# DaUNCCLoginPhishingPage

Currently a work in progress, I noticed the UNCC login page wasn't hard to turn into an easy phishing page so I decided to do just that. Only thing that is different from the original code is that it has a PHP password storing page. Please report bugs as I do not know PHP, I only know Javascript for now.
